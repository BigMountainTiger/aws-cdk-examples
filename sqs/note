1. An SQS needs to explicitly grant persmissions on it for it to be accessible (See CDK Stack)
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-basic-examples-of-sqs-policies.html

2. Lambda integration with SQS, the lambda needs 'sqs:DeleteMessage', 'sqs:GetQueueAttributes', 'sqs:ReceiveMessage' persmissions
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs-example.html
  - If exceptions thrown from the lambda, the message will remain in the queue and visible after the visibility timeout
  - If there is a dead-letter queue, it will be moved to the dead-letter queue after the "Max Receive Count"

3. Delivery Delay - Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of seconds
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html
  - It affects the messages when it is first time added to the queue, default 0, max 15 minutes

4. Visibility Timeout - When a message is returned by a "Receive Message" call, it is set invisible to other calls until the timeout
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html
  - Default 30 seconds, min 0, max 12 hours

5. Receive Message WaitTime - Long polling / short polling
  - When issuing "aws sqs receive-message", how long to wait if no message in the queeue at the time of request. If not provided as a parameter, 
    default is the value set on the queue
  - Receive Message WaitTime can be set on the queue so it takes effect on all the requests by default.

6. SQS can be accessed by other accounts if permission is granted

7. SQS message retention time is 1 minute to 14 days. Default it 4 days.

8. Max message size is 256K.

9. You can access SQS using HTTP directly if permission is granted
