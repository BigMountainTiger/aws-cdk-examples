# Welcome to Slack-bot-jira-app project

This is the Slack-bot-jira-app project.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`               list the available cdk stacks in the project
 * `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
