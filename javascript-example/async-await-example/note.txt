1. Javascript code can run in different functions. As long as the code access the same data, the result can be correct
2. A promise can resolve and reject, it can flattern chained callbacks (by then() and catch()). Exceptions in promise, if happens in callbacks,
    they will not be caught in the catch() function
3. async and await is equivalent to promise and callbacks
4. await can only be used in async functions
5. An async function always returns a promise, it is either "awaitted" or processed by then() function
6. If await a non-async function, it still equivalent to the then() function.
